- 
### 4. [Python para FinancÃßas AnaÃÅlise de Dados e Machine Learning]
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Finished 
- **Institution:** IA Expert Academy(Jones Granatyr)
- **Description:** In this course you'll get a theoretical and mainly practical step-by-step overview of the main concepts of Finance and Investments, as well as implementation in the Python programming language and applications of Machine Learning to financial databases. What sets this course apart is that we will be using databases of Brazilian companies taken from the S√£o Paulo Stock Exchange (BOVESPA), as well as solving exercises in every section. This way, you'll be able to practice immediately after learning the concepts! The content is divided into two parts: in the first you will learn the basic concepts of finance and in the second part we will apply machine learning to databases with financial information.
- **Content:** Extraction of financial databases from the Internet, Creation of dynamic charts for visualizing financial information, Analysis of histograms, boxplots, and line charts for interpreting databases, Calculation of simple return and logarithmic return, Risk calculation using statistical metrics such as standard deviation, variance, covariance, and correlation coefficient, Analysis of similar companies using the correlation coefficient, Calculation of Sharpe ratio and Markowitz for stock portfolio analysis, Asset allocation in a portfolio to reduce risks and increase profits, Use of intelligent optimization algorithms to select the best assets in a portfolio. We will implement the following algorithms: hill climb, simulated annealing, and genetic algorithms, Calculation of the famous CAPM (Capital Asset Pricing Model) for asset pricing, Implementation of Monte Carlo Simulations for stock price forecasting, Generation of best and worst-case price scenarios with Monte Carlo Simulations, Use of ARIMA and Facebook Prophet algorithms for stock price forecasting, Complete preprocessing of a database with characteristics of more than 300 BOVESPA companies, aiming to predict the best companies for long-term investment, Application of the k-means algorithm for clustering companies with similar characteristics, Visualization and exploration of Twitter texts about finance, as well as extracting the companies people are talking about and generating the most frequent topics/words, Creation of a sentiment classifier to indicate whether a text about finance is positive or negative
- **Projects:** Links to projects developed in the course
